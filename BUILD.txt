1	crystal socket**

* A 512k sram may be fitted, but the board lacks hardware to effectively map more than 256k.  A jumper under the ram socket connects A18 to ground.
** Oscillator cans don't tend to stick well in DIP sockets.  It's recommended to either have a specific socket type or solder the oscillator to the board.

Assembly:
If your board is from VCFMW 13, it's likely that all SMT components are already mounted.  Bare-board purchases may not be this way.

Mount the surface mount components first.  The surrounding components will interfere with soldering later.
* The 74lxc244 may be mounted before the USB jack to aid in drag soldering.

Mount the chip sockets if provided

Mount the oscillator (X1)

Mount the discrete components:
